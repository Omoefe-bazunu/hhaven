        title: 'Walking in Faith',
        content: `What you are about to learn in this book might come as a shock to you as it might not be exactly what you were expecting based on your present knowledge of the subject. Be rest assured that it is in no way a mere opinion but is in fact the uncommon and unpopular truth which many like yourself might have overlooked when going through the pages of the holy bible, or have never really heard or paid careful attention to. If we asked you what you think the gift of speaking in tongues is and how important it is to Christians, your answer might be one of the following;
Option 1: The gift of tongues is a heavenly language that is given to a Christian when he/she receives the holy spirit from God after conversion. It is used to communicate with God in a special way that cannot be interrupted by Satan or his agents.
Option 2: The gift of tongues is a spiritual language that Christians can use to cast out Satan and his demons and to elevate their prayers in a way that provides desired and fast results.
If your answer was any one of the above we humbly encourage you the more to keep reading this book as you will be discovering some really interesting truth.
You will agree that as Christians we are commanded and bound to worship God Almighty and our Savior Jesus Christ based on the truth as we find it in the holy bible and not based on our personal opinion or the opinions of any Christian group. See 2Peter 1:20; Matthew 15:7-9.
More so, a Christian who sincerely desires to worship God in the way that pleases God will have an open mind to learn the truth of God’s word and keep to it even when it requires such person to put aside some long-standing ideas and practices which he has now found out to not be in harmony with the truth.
On this subject of SPEAKING IN TONGUES, to give a proper answer to what it really is, we rely solely on the record of the holy bible where the origin of the gift can be found. At this point we encourage you to get a copy of the holy bible and turn to the book of ACTS 2: 1-14. This is the passage where we find the origin or beginning of the gift of tongues and where we can learn what exactly it is and what it was meant for.
